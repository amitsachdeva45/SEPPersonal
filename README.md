Function: Gamman Function

This function is divided into 2 parts:
1) For Integer value
2) For Real Value

Formula Used to calculate gamma function

T represents Gamman Function

  T(a) = (a-1)! for all positive Integers I+
  
  T(a) = infinity for all negative integers I- as well as 0
  
  T(a) = integration(t^(a-1)*exp(t)) on dt with limits is from 0 to infinity
  
  
Domain:

Gamma function is defined for all Real Numbers excluding negative integers and 0.

Codomain:

It ranges from -infinity to infinity
