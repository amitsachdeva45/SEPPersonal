Function: Gamma Function

This function is divided into 2 parts:
1) For Integer value
2) For Real Value

Definition: It acts like a factorial operation from positive integers to real and even complex values of the argument 


Formula Used to calculate gamma function

T represents Gamman Function

  Γ(a) = (a-1)! for all positive Integers I+
  
  Γ(a) = infinity for all negative integers I- as well as 0
  
  Γ(a) = integration(t^(a-1)*exp(-t)) on dt with limits is from 0 to infinity
  
In general:

Γ(a+1) = aΓ(a)
  
Γ(a) =∫∞ 0 t^(a−1)*exp(−t)dt, Re(a)>0  
          
Domain:

Gamma function is defined for all Real Numbers excluding negative integers and 0.

Codomain:

It ranges from -infinity to infinity
